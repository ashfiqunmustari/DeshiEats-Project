# **DeshiEats**

This project was developed as part of the Information System Design and Software Engineering Lab during our third year of the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program. The focus was to apply theoretical concepts of system design, database management, and software engineering into a practical, real-world application.

## **Overview**

DeshiEats is a web-based platform that provides home cooks and small entrepreneurs with the opportunity to establish and manage their own cloud kitchens. It connects them with food enthusiasts, promoting local culinary talent and offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional restaurants. The project emphasizes the use of modern web development and database technologies, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## **Technologies Used**

**•	JavaScript:** For creating interactive and dynamic client-side functionalities.
**•	PHP:** Server-side scripting to handle backend logic and server-client communication.
**•	HTML & CSS:** For structuring and styling the website, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
**•	Bootstrap:** To streamline the development of the user interface with pre-designed components.
**•	MySQL:** For robust database management, including data storage and retrieval to support dynamic web functionalities.

## **Key Features**

**•	User-Friendly Interface:** Simplified design for seamless navigation.
**•	Cloud Kitchen Management:** Tools for managing menus, orders, and customer interactions.
**•	Community Engagement:** A platform for food enthusiasts to explore and share culinary experiences.
**•	Efficient Backend:** Scalable architecture ensuring smooth performance even with growing user bases.
